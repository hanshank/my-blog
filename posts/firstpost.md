Let me tell you about something that I have a lot of passion for. As a part of Talentpath's training, my self and 4 other developers have started creating a full-stack web application. Our original idea was to create a website for sports enthusiasts to stay up to date on their favorite sports teams. We quickly decided to change it into awebsite where users can stay up to date on all NFL games through an interactive game where users estimate the winners of NFL games while discussing and interacting with friends and strangers a like in reddit-styled game threads.

## What is rapid prototyping?
Not all developers are great designers. I've been on a jurney my self, and would not call my self a designer. But I have learned a few simple ways that has made my life so much easier when designing web applications. Our team went for something called rapid prototyping. It is basically a way of creating wireframes in a short amount of time, instead of using months on perfecting it. The design will have to change to fit the users needs anyways. We were able to create a pretty good looking design in ONE WEEK! That's not bad! Is it perfect? No. But it get's us a long way. Here is the process we used:


### 1. Decide on the core features of the application
We first had to decide what problem we were trying to solve with our app and what features and pages would help us solve that problem the best. We decided to create four main pages:
- Landing page with a signup call to action
- List of NFL games
- Game Thread for each game
- A leaderboard for the users

### 2. Create a user flow.
The user flow is basically the direction in where we want to guide our users on the page. We decided to make the user land on our landing page and try to convince them to signup using a cool marketing video that shows off our application. Next to it is a signup form. From signing up, the user will be directed to the list of NFL games. Here the user will be able to click in to each game and participate in the community discussion as well as reading up on everything they need to know about the game. Our main feature is a commenting/betting function, where each comment inside the game thread costs pizza slices. Before commenting on a particular game, you will be asked to choose an amount of pizza slices to bet. Every other user can then see each others bets and comment as much as they want. This is where we want our users to spend the most amount of time

### 3. Prototyping
Next we take our ideas to the whiteboard, or rather, our favorite design tools. We mostly used Sketch and Figma for this. Step one is to come up with something that just displays the general idea of how each page should look, nothing too detailed or fancy here. After receiving feedback and reviewing each page, we moved on to deciding on the theme, fonts and color palette of the website. From there we started creating a fully-fledged wireframe, which is supposed to look as close to the finished website as possible.

### 4. Create a style guide
When the designing is done, it's very important to share with all the developers as much info as you can about the design. The way we keep all of this available for everyone, is through a wiki repository inside of our Slice It Github organization. This way, all the developers on our team will know what color codes, font families, paddings, margins etc. to use when converting the wireframe to a design.

## Final Thoughts
I personally love designing. It is a stage of the app creating process where you can get really creative! I highly recommend following the steps outlined above before getting into coding your app. It will make your application look 100 times better! Good luck!
